                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>It all started with the discovery of something they termed “the god particle” though it would be many years before the true discovery would take place, however, this was an important step in the process.</p>
                        <p>The person who first had the theory was a particle physicist by the name of Howard Zedos, his views on how the makeup of the universe could be boiled down to a set number of elements kickstarted the world's scientific research toward that end.</p>
                        <p>In the end, it took time, money, and luck. Stumbling on it almost by accident the scientists of the early thirtieth century called it the Zedos Particle, as it all but confirmed his theories. The makeup of the universe, or what looked like the cause of its creation consisted of seven major constructs of nature. Combustion, Precipitation, Atmosphere, Potential Energy, Galvanism, Terra, and Alloy.</p>
                        <p>It was so impossibly small that viewing it took the most advanced techniques and technology, and so even after its discovery it would be many years before they would learn to harness it. And so, in the year 3465 CCED Humanity became gods.</p> 
                        <p>The ability to manipulate the core of existence allowed its wielders to break down and combine the essence of life to create impossibilities. With the slightest shift of galvanism and terra one could create stones that could power entire cities, a mix of potential energy and alloy created entire forests of growing metal trees, precipitation and atmosphere and a touch of combustion allowed the influence of any weather pattern imaginable. humanity entered a golden age with endless resources, a near-infinite energy supply, and total manipulation of atmospheric events. A utopia unlike any had seen before. Heights were reached that never could have been thought possible. The future was limitless. No one would have thought it would ever end, could never have even imagined the disaster that would end everything.</p> 
                        <p>There are no records of exactly what happened. Be it an activist or terrorist group, a natural disaster, or simply an accident. One day, humanity disappeared, and the world and all its creations were wiped out. It could have taken years, or it could have happened in one cataclysmic flash. Of all that was recovered afterward, there was only one prevalent theory. As written in nearly every religious text, what is given can also be taken away. The miracle that had blessed the world had two components. Before it could create something new, it had to disassemble.</p>
                        <p>And so the world was reset, leaving scarce ruins of a once great civilization, nearly everything brought into a base state. There needed to be something to begin the particle's creation process, be it a remnant of the technology used to harness the particle, a spark or catalyst by nature, or some movement of a divine being. As if the earth took a deep breath, life began to explode into existence. Creation incarnate, the mixture of an entire planet indiscriminately combining and forming new plant life, new creatures, shifting land masses and bodies of water. And out of this chaos arose intelligent life.</p>
                        <p>Those creatures that live in relative proximity to humans managed to inherit the most DNA and matter from them, creating many races of different combinations. The most dominant and populated were, dogs, cats, lizards, birds, and rats.</p>
                        <p>For these races and classes of new intelligent life, things were beginning, waking up to a world in the very process of creation is a daunting and dangerous experience in the best of circumstances. Yet these new creatures had no past and awakened as babies to an inevitable reality. Yet in all this confusion, a leader arose, uniting warring tribes of separate races which had sprung up into a new united tribe of mixed races, sharing one common goal of survival. Forming one of the strongest tribes on the planet. This leader was a canine by the name of Nikki</p>
                        <p>With the combined effort of these five races, each with their skills and assets, Nikki traveled the dangerous wilderness of ever-changing landscapes and wildlife. After years of survival, they stumbled upon a human creation that seemed untouched by the blast that had ended the world. A world seed with the capability to terraform and improve life on desolate planets. They discovered knowledge libraries that led them to an advanced way of life and soon they were able to understand the ships design.</p>
